          In order to mobilize community members towards decarbonization, we use
          a hybrid approach combining physical engagement, powered by a digital
          App to guide community members to become *prosumers.*
        question: Community Mobilization
      - answer: >-
          Our community electrification strategy is based on the development of
          community-owned mini-grids and *prosumer blocks* composed by solar PV,
          energy storage, and energy management system, EV car sharing, and a
          Blockchain backbone.
        question: Community Electrification
      - answer: >-
          Additional to electricity generation, our protocol includes the
          integration of two types of community-owned EV car-sharing services as
          well as EV vanpooling, therefore minimizing the use of fossil fuel
          vehicles.
        question: Mobility Electrification
      - answer: >-
          Our decarbonization and electrification protocol is a network designed
          with a micro-grid controller able to be disconnected from the main
          grid in time of emergencies.
